# 🍷 Wine Quality — Decision Tree

Interactive demo training a Decision Tree on the combined UCI red/white wine dataset.

**Modes**

- **Regression**: predicts numeric quality (MAE, RMSE, R²)
- **Classification**: predicts discrete class (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)

**What you’ll see**

- Metrics table
- Feature importance
- Confusion matrix (classification only)
- Full tree plot

> Note: On first run, the app downloads the UCI CSVs; subsequent runs use cached files.
