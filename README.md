# ML Demos â€” Wine Quality


This repository contains interactive ML demos built in Python with **Gradio** and designed for deployment on **Hugging Face Spaces**.  
Each demo uses the [UCI Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality).

## Demos

- **Decision Tree**  
  Train and visualize a Decision Tree for wine quality prediction.  
  [Open on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AlbanDelamarre/DT_WineQuality)

- **Random Forest**  
  Train and evaluate a Random Forest, explore feature importances and metrics.
